Create filelist:

List of REMOVED and MODIFIED files from target patch to current patch
Would need to look for a way to generate lists for older patches than 1 in the past (Cumulative?)

Downgrading process:
Backup files (Affected directories only? Keep track of added/removed files and only back those up?)
Remove Files that were added in depot during current patch
Download files that were MODIFIED and REMOVED during current patch
