# AoE2 DE Patcher - WIP

Patches AoE2 DE to any officially released version (Steam version only!)  
Currently best suited for downgrading. Upgrading (If not via backup) takes significantly longer

# Requirements

- Requires a steam account that owns the game
- Requires [.Net Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/current/runtime) to run

# Usage
- Start aoe2de_patcher.exe
- Select desired game version & language (Language setting only affects cutscenes / campaign voice overs)
- Select the game directory
- Enter your steam login credentials
- Click \<Patch>
- If prompted, enter the 2FA code
- To restore the previous game version hit \<Restore> after patching (Make sure the game is not open in steam anymore since it will show an error then)

This whole process might take a while to finish!

# Notes
**Your login creedentials will not be stored.** 

~~While it is possible to patch from an old version to the most recent one~~ As of now this is no longer possible - I do suggest to just use the steam "Verify integrity of game cache" functionality just to be extra safe. 

For now, try to avoid closing the program via task manager while it is downloading. Currently I have not found a way to guarantee that downloads will be stopped after doing so!

# FAQ
*I will add questions and answers here when they arise*

# Future features
- Investigate options to improve upgrading mechanism
- Get pre 35584 versions to work
- Add toggle for Enhanced graphics pack (Warn people because thats a lot of data)
- Maybe add a \<cancel> button
- Make backups optional  
- If you have any other suggestions, feel free to open a ticket and tag it with 'enhancement'
