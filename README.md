# AoE2 DE Patcher - WIP

Patches AoE2 DE to any officially released version (Steam version only!)  
Currently best suited for downgrading. Upgrading (If not via backup) takes significantly longer

# Requirements

- Requires a steam account that owns the game
- Requires [.Net Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/current/runtime) to run

# Usage
- Select desired game version & language (Language setting only affects cutscenes / campaign voice overs for that language)
- Select the game directory
- Enter your steam login credentials
- Click \<Patch>
- If prompted, enter the 2FA code
- To restore the previous game version hit \<Restore> after patching

This whole process might take a while to finish!

# Notes
**Your login creedentials will not be stored.** 

While it is possible to patch from an old version to the most recent one I do suggest to just use the steam "Verify integrity of game cache" functionality just to be extra safe. 

For now, try to avoid closing the program via task manager while it is downloading. Currently I have not found a way to guarantee that downloads will be stopped after doing so!

# Future features
- Further improve update process for upgrading patches (And maybe see if its possible to optimize downgrading)
- Add toggle for Enhanced graphics pack (Warn people because thats a lot of data)
- Maybe add a \<cancel> button
- Make backups optional  
- If you have any other suggestions, feel free to open a ticket and tag it with 'enhancement'
