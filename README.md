# AoE2PatchReverter - WIP

Patches AoE2 DE to any officially released version (Steam version only!)  
Currently downloads the whole update instead of just patching the necessary files, an improved mechanism is planned though!

As soon as I finished my other work i will continue to improve the update process!  
As long as no major bugs arise i will probably come back in a few days to this.

# Requirements

- Requires a steam account that owns the game
- Requires [.Net Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/current/runtime) to run

# Usage
- Select desired game version & language (Language setting only effects cutscenes / capaign voice overs for that language)
- Select the game directory
- Enter your steam login credentials
- Click \<Patch>
- If prompted, enter the 2FA code (Might occur multiple times)
- To restore the previous game version hit \<Restore> after patching

This whole process takes a while to finish!

# Notes
This project is not done yet. There may be bugs and issues and it's possible not everything is working as intended. If you encounter any bugs please open a Ticket with the bug you encountered and a short desceription how it occured.

Your login creedentials will not be stored for later use

The downloaded files are from steam directly and not hosted by me

**Future features**
- Improve the update process (Only update the files that need updating)
- Add toggle for Enhanced graphics pack (Warn people because thats a lot of data)
- Maybe add a \<cancel> button
