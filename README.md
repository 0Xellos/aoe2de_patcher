# AOE2PatchReverter - WIP

Patches AoE2 DE to any officially released version (Steam version only!)  

# Requirements

- Requires a steam account that owns the game
- Requires [.Net Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/) to run

# Usage
- Select the game directory
- Enter your steam login credentials
- Click \<Patch>
- If prompted, enter the 2FA code (Might occur multiple times)
- To restore the previous game version hit \<Restore> after patching

This whole process takes a while to finish!

# Notes
This project is not done yet. There may be bugs and issues and it's possible not everything is working as intended. If you encounter any bugs please open a Ticket with the bug you encountered and a short desceription how it occured.

Your login creedentials will not be stored for later use

The downloaded files are from steam directly and not hosted by me

**Future features**
- Grab Update list directly from steam
- Grab manifest ids directly from steam
- Improve the update process (Only update the files that need updating)
- Validate that it is indeed the AoE2 DE directory
